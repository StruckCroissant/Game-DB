# Game-DB:
**A web-based game search engine powered by Spring, Java, MySQL, and Angular**

# **Description:**
Welcome! This project is a web-app that I initially started in a databases class. 
It used to be a Java Swing app, and now the aim is to expand it into a webapp and deploy it to docker.

# **Stack:**
As of right now the project has a Spring-boot & MariaDB based backend and a AngularJS based frontend. There are some
additional plugins on the backend such as Thymeleaf and Flyway. At present the MariaDB database is deployed in a docker
container.
